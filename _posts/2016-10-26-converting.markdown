I used an essay I wrote for my jazz class for my written work. It is a listening journal that I wrote analysing Charlie Parker’s “Ko Ko”. Charlie Parker is one of Jazz’s most famous bebop musician with dozens of beautifully articulated recordings. Getting the multiple formats to work wasn’t too difficult of a task since you gave us many resources to convert my markdown file to jazz.docx, jazz.pdf, jazz.odt, and jazz.html. I went back to our schedule and looked at “Single Input, Multiple Outputs” which is when we worked in groups to practice our converting skills. This gave me reference so I could convert all the different files. While working on this I thought I wouldn’t have too much trouble but oh boy was I wrong. On our last day of working on this project I accidently ended up deleting all my work which was a total setback. I tried to be resourceful and copy and paste the problem that cloud 9 gave me to google. I thought it was all good until I realized the information I got from stack overflow totally screwed up everything. I couldn’t fix it and it left me stranded, frustrated, and annoyed. Soon I was able to get help from you but it was definitely a setback. Once I got back on track I didn’t encounter any bigger problems than that. My only other issue was that my images weren’t converting for any of my files, until I realized that I had to have the image in a subfolder with the image in it. After this realization, the files converted beautifully. I thought this was an awesome project, that has valuable real world skills. I learned how to convert many different document types using pandoc. I was able to learn some script which was pretty awesome to do. I polished my markdown skills by text formatting, creating tables, etc. I also like the idea of repetitive use of skills. This sets us up to indefinitely learn the skills that we have learned in the past. For example, the markdown and adding a blog to our website, both of which were something we learned from our last project. It’s exciting to have all these skills come together to create such awesome interactive projects.
