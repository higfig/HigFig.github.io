REFLECTION on Assignment 6

I came into this project unsure of where my skills stood, but as I worked more and more on the project I was overall pleased with my work. I felt like I actually was prepared and had the information needed to do well. I was partnered with Lily and we decided to do our presentation on Bitcoins. Our jobs were spread out evenly, I did the “one partner” section that included starting up the project so that we could begin our presentation. Both of us decided to do research and re-group when we had a good ideas about what we were going to talk about. I decided to make an outline to make the process much easier. We both brainstormed in order to figure out what our headings would be and what information was most important to talk about. This part didn’t talk long considering you told us what would be best to talk about using the hourglass method for presentations. We easily figured out what the top, middle and bottom of the hourglass would be and how we would present it. We then went on to do our audio. Audacity was not being cooperative with us at the beginning. For some reason our mics weren’t working and we weren’t able to record anything. This wasn’t until we finally resorted to our own laptops. It finally worked after messing around for almost an hour. Once Audacity was working we were on our way to creating our audio files. We followed the instructions you gave us and easily figured out how to export our files. The challenge wasn’t until we actually uploaded the audio files into cloud 9. For some odd reason our audio wasn’t working and it was only playing audio from the example. This was frustrating and took lots of troubleshooting. Finally a light bulb lit and Lily figured out that the audio files had to be in order and named accordingly. The first audio file had to be 0.0, then 1.0, 2.0 and so on. This way the first slide was aligned with the audio associated with 0.0. 

The audacity problem was our biggest issue, from there we just had minor problems that essentially were cloud 9 issues. Mostly the loading of our slides were wack because UNC wifi hates cloud 9. Other minor issues included, changing our background color, changing the heading size, and trying to get our youtube video to work. In the end we never got our youtube video to work but we improvised with other information. This project involved a lot of troubleshooting and figuring out what tools worked best in order to create the best presentation. These tools involved, `pandoc`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `reveal`, `audacity`, and many more. All great skills that will hopefully better my presentations in the near future.  

I hope to use reveal in the future to make presentations that involve more spazz and excitement. I know it will be a tool that I can introduce to people in order to vary their horizon. Hopefully I can encourage friends to also dive into reveal and give it a chance. This way they can be informed about other presentation methods and never have to use boring powerpoint slides. In the end this class has helped me change my attitude about troubleshooting. It has taught me to troubleshoot and troubleshoot and troubleshoot some more. It made me realize the more I troubleshoot the more I get better at it and am able to retrieve the right information. I am happy to say that I know this skill will be my biggest takeaway from this class.
