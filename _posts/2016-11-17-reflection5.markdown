REFLECTION on Assignment 5


For our script we decided to go with simple questions. We coded to `read` and `echo` very generic questions that weren’t difficult to answer. We ask for your name, color, age, movie, and hair. By answering all these question we were able to store the information in an .sql file. Our README explains what steps you need to take in order for our script to work. Overall this project was the most difficult one. I encountered many bumps throughout this assignment that left me and my group members stranded. As a group we did struggle but came out victorious. We decided that Tabitha would create the repository and type out what was needed, with Kelsey and I doing the research. Our first issue was actually the beginning of the assignment, we didn’t understand what exactly you meant by “Then cd into that new directory and rm -rf .git to remove the assignment 4 git tracking. Do not do this in your assignment 5 repository.” We soon figured out it wasn’t as difficult as we made it out to be and removed the git tracking on assignment 4. Our next problems weren’t too big considering they stopped us for no more than 10 minutes. This was true until we hit step 5, now here is where we were lost lambs. We did not know how to connect to a MySQL database, we did research but weren’t finding anything. This only left us with the choice of asking for your help. You gave us information that was very helpful and helped us acknowledge where we were going wrong. Little by little were were able to piece the code that was needed for our script. We used our class notes, the web and each other until we finally came up with the right working code. Many times we put in the wrong code and had problems with it not running right. One of these errors included our date not working like it was supposed to. We found out that we had to change our datatype to put in the right date. Little things like that set us back. After this we thought we were solid and had it easy for the rest of the assignment. We were gravely mistaken. We didn’t exactly know how to dump our MySQL database into a .sql file. The internet truly has so much information. There was such a variety of information regarding our questions that was typed into google. Everytime we worded our query differently, new information would come up. This left us having to ask google the right question. Finally we came across the correct code from stackoverflow. Surely this had to be our last issue, right? NOPE. Finally we came across our last issue. Making our database not overwrite the information every time someone else ran it. Once again, our research came to our rescue and after many minutes of research we found the right code. One thing I definitely took away from this project was, putting in the right question into google will go very far.
