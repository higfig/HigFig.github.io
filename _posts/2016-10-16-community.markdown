For my community event I went to UNC Fall Gamefest. It was an event hosted by UNC Chapel Hill Esports. The event itself was a LAN tournament event. They hosted several tournaments and casual game stations all around Sitterson Hall!
There last LAN, Spring Gamefest 2016, hosted over 300 attendees, with more than 100 of them being students from different schools across North Carolina!
Even if you werenâ€™t interested in what they had to offer they also included non-competitive playing. It was a great event that I got to socialize and support many of my peers. The technology offered included different video games, virtual reality, older game systems and much more. It was an awesome event that I will hopefully go to next semester.
