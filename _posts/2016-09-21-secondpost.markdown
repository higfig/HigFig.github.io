I wanted to bring a website that incorporated the world simple in all of its contents. Sometimes a clean, fresh website is nice and satisfying to navigate through. I was hoping to bring that experience by also added valuable information that pertained to the "Simple" motto. I gave humorous ideas on how to do everyday things aswell as information on how to vacation. Two things that are both very important to the well being of us humans; to make life as easy as it can get. I hope you enjoy the simplistic platfrom I brought to you. Here is a chill mix that you can listen to while navigating yourself through the website: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRLw55eGMn8`
