Hello! Welcome to my website and to my first blog post! This class has been a roller coaster of information. I have learned so much about github, cloud9, markup, html, css, etc. At first I was intimidating by all the different coding and commands that were being used. I have only worked with Java programming before, which is totally different than the material in this class. The first few days were kind of a blur for me, considering I wasnâ€™t grasping all the different commands. Then as each class passed we would dive straight into hands on activities and as the more we did the more knowledge I gained. I started to understand what commands did what and when to use certain commands. These commands included how to commit changes, how to push, how to make testing branches, etc. The more hands on we got the more the information I retained. Vocabulary has also been valuable for understanding many concepts. These vocabulary words include: network, DNS, IP addresses, clients, servers, version control, etc. I hope to learn much more as this class progresses.
