My first post
Hello! I am **Uriel Navarro!** I am a sophomore at `The University of North Carolina at Chapel hill!` I am planning on studying Computer Science and Information Science. Since day one of INLS 161 I have learned lots of new information. I have learned how to work with github and cloud 9.
